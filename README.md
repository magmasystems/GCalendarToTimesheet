# GCalendarToTimesheet

This is an app that is only really useful to Marc Adler and the way he accumulates client hours in his Google Sheets timesheet.

It will go through the week's Google Calendar, looking for the name of a CaaS client within the summary of the invitation. Then it will create a map of all of the different clients, the hours that Marc put into each meeting every day, and then it will insert those entries in the corresponding client tab inthe Google timesheet.
